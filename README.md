## Random Password Generator
#### PROBLEM STATEMENT (Random Password)

Write a program to generate random password which have the following features: -
1) The password should have minimum length of 12 characters and maximum length of 32
characters.
2) Password will always start with a lower-case alphabet and ends with a uppercase alphabet.
3) It should have at least 2 lower case alphabet, 2 upper case alphabet, 1 number, and 1 special
character. No space allowed in generated password.
4) You should not use any dictionary for password generation.
5) Do not use inbuilt function for randomisation make your own pseudo-random number
generator.
6) GUI - There should be one button for generating password which will be shown on same
screen inside some label, there should be one button which will copy the password on the clipboard.

#### SCOPE OF DEVELOPMENT

The password generated by the algorithm working behind the scene is good but the random password generated by it is still in pseudo form i.e. its not really generating random number as our system cannot generate real random number. So this is like a shortcoming to this which can removed if embed a random number generator machine or tool with our system, take its data and then generate the password that would really be random password.
